            <p>Hello, my name is Ivana.  I am in the process of a significant career change. I am currently enrolled in the UA Bootcamp
             to learn coding and become Full Stack Web Developer. After being a stay-at-home mom for about 17 years, I have decided to take 
             the plunge and go back to school. While it is extremely challenging, I have the passion and determination for learning new things.</p>

            <p>I was born and grew up in Czech Republic. I lived in four countries and beside my mother’s tongue, I speak English and French. Previously, I have worked at Motorola in Czech 
             Republic and Motorola S.A. in France. Currently, I work as a substitute teacher at Gilbert Christian Schools and I am para-professional certified 
             to work with the special-need students.</p> 
             
            <p>I believe that kindness, mindfulness and positive thinking are the essential agents for success and make positive changes in people’s lives. 
             I have been blessed with a wonderful family of my own and I love spending time with them. I love animals and I am a proud owner of five fur babies, 
             one Golden Doodle and four kitties. Besides hanging out with my family, I enjoy traveling, reading, theatre, music, hiking, and cooking.</p>
